### Description

A VB replacement for the old WebCam 2000 software, which no longer works under Windows 2000. It's a WebCam with a difference - it doesn't take the picture until a request comes in! This is good for lowering the hits on your CPU AND bandwidth, because it doesn't waste its time taking a picture and uploading it every 5 minutes like most WebCams do.

It sits on port 2000, and when a request comes in, it grabs the picture via TWAIN, saves it as a JPG, and sends the picture to the person.
